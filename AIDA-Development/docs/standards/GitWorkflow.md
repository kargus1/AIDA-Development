### **From an issue**

When viewing an issue, you can create an associated branch directly from that page. Branches created this way use the [default pattern for branch names from issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/branches/#configure-default-pattern-for-branch-names-from-issues), including variables.

5. Select **Create branch** to create the branch based on your projectâ€™s [default branch](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/branches/default.html).
